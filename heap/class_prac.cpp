// efficient task scheduling in a multi-processor system a compnay is designing a multi- processor system where multiple tasks need to be scheduled based on their priority. each task has a priority value( higher value means higher priority), and the system must execute tasks in order of priority while maintaining efficient insertion and deletion.

// to solve this problem, a heap-based priority queue is used. The system should:

// insert new tasks dynamically into the heap. rebalance the heap after each task completion.
